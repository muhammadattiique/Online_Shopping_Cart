# Online_Shopping_Cart
A simple web-based Online Shopping Cart built to practice core web development skills. It allows users to view products and manage cart items using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, running on a XAMPP local server. This project focuses on basic user-level functionality, frontend–backend interaction, and session handling.
